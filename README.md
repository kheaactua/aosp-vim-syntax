# aosp-vim-symtax

Syntax files for `bp`, `rc`, `aidl`, 'logcat', 'slog' and `hal` files.

The `rc` syntax is directly sourced from
[rubberduck203/aosp-vim](https://github.com/rubberduck203/aosp-vim).  The rest
was put together reasonably quickly to meet my needs and is not comprehensive.

Note the slog formatting only has an impact if the slog was output with the -S
flag which prints out the log threshold.
